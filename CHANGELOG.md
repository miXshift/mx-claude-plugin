# Changelog

All notable changes to the `mixshift-ai` plugin are recorded here. This log
starts at 0.5.39; earlier versions predate the changelog.

## 0.5.39

A correctness and consistency release. It folds in a full review pass across
the skills, hardens the build, and renames one skill for consistency.

### Changed

- **Renamed the `mx-report-pull` skill to `mx-amazon-report`.** This lines it up
  with the rest of the Amazon API skills (`mx-amazon-ads`, `mx-amazon-retail`,
  `mx-amazon-amc`, `mx-amazon-dsp`). The slash command is now
  `/mixshift-ai:mx-amazon-report`. The underlying `mixshift amazon report ...`
  CLI commands are unchanged, so any scripts that call the CLI keep working.

### Fixed

- Onboarding now points to the correct command for ad-hoc SQL
  (`mixshift data query`).
- Unattended and scheduled sessions locate their service credential reliably at
  run time instead of assuming a fixed path.
- The AMC and DSP skills now discover instances and advertisers correctly when
  the signed-in account manages other accounts, including seats and advertiser
  IDs that sit beneath a managed account.
- Large advertiser and account identifiers are read back without rounding.
- Amazon Ads write actions (for example pausing campaigns or changing bids)
  preview a dry run first and require an explicit, separate confirmation before
  anything is committed.
- Search Query Performance and Brand Analytics tables now show up when listing
  available warehouse tables.
- Live featured-offer pricing reads are attributed to the correct merchant and
  marketplace.

### Removed

- Removed the `mx-competitive-analysis` skill. It was an internal MixShift tool
  that was not intended to ship in the public plugin.

### Internal

- Added continuous integration (type-check, test suite, manifest and skill
  validation, version-consistency check, build) on every pull request.
- Added a golden-fixture test layer built on fully synthetic brand data.
